A dapp that allows the user to send ERC20 tokens and track their transactions.
The dapp is designed specifically for the Metamask browser extension.
The dapp allows for:
* Sending of select ERC20 tokens
* Sending on the Ethereum mainnet or Sepolia testnet
* Live gas fee estimates
* Live mining time estimates
* Transaction monitoring
* Speeding up transactions with higher gas fees (via the Metamask extension) and monitoring the new transaction (in dapp)
* Cancelling transactions (via the Metamask extension) and monitoring the cancellation progress (in dapp)
* Transaction history specific for each Metamask account, network, and browser

(*) Dapp features have been tested in Brave, Chrome and Microsoft Edge. All features should work in all other browsers. The only exception being Microsoft Edge which does not allow transaction history to be retained across multiple browser sessions due to the browser clearing localStorage upon browser close.
